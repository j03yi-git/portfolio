              <p>A web application developed for the EduHelper project, aimed at enhancing accessibility in education.</p>
              <p>As part of this project, I implemented user account management, including login, registration, profile updates, and account deletion.</p>
              <p>I also developed a quiz feature that allowed users to take, update, and delete quizzes, along with a statistics page displaying pass/fail rates to provide users with insights on their performance.</p>
              <p>My responsibilities extended to database design and integration, where I structured the schema, identified key entities and attributes, and wrote SQL queries to efficiently retrieve and store data.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I implemented JWT authentication to secure user access, ensuring only authorized users could interact with protected endpoints. I also created a utility to manage session expirations and unauthorized access handling.</p>
              <p>Below are several notable accessibility features I implemented:</p>              

            <h3>Account Management</h3>
            <video width="100%" height="320" controls>

              Your browser does not support the video tag.
              </video> 
              <p>Implemented full user account management, including <span class="bold">registration, login, profile updates, and account deletion</span>. Utilized <span class="bold">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</span> for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to user data and protected endpoints.</p>
              <p>Developed a session management system where expired or invalid tokens automatically redirect users to the login page, improving security and user experience.</p>
              <p>Integrated the frontend with the backend API, using <span class="bold">GET and POST</span> requests to handle user data efficiently.</p>

            <h3>Quizzes to Assess Disabilities</h3>

              <p>Developed a quiz feature that allows users to <span class="bold">take, update, and delete quizzes</span>, designed to assess various disabilities.</p>
              <p>Implemented database functionality to store and retrieve quiz data, ensuring each quiz and question is dynamically managed.</p>
              <p>Created a <span class="bold">statistics page</span> to display quiz pass/fail rates, providing users with insights into their results and fostering a sense of community support.</p>
              <p>Integrated the frontend with the backend API to fetch quiz questions and submit responses, ensuring seamless data handling.</p>

            <h3>Trivia Quizzes</h3>

                <p>Integrated a <span class="bold">third-party trivia API</span> to dynamically fetch multiple-choice quiz questions, ensuring a diverse and engaging quiz experience.</p>
                <p>Developed a system to <span class="bold">retrieve, display, and submit quiz responses</span>, with instant scoring feedback for users.</p>
                <p>Implemented logic to track and display user scores, allowing them to review results and retake quizzes if desired.</p>
                <p>Connected the frontend with the backend API to efficiently handle quiz retrieval and submission.</p>

            <p>a c++ console app connected to a folder of csv files holding mock movie and actor data, created for a data structures and algorithms module.</p>
            <p>working in a pair, we built the app on c++, using the <span class="bold">fstream and sstream</span> libraries to read and write data from the csv files. we created our own data structures, and utilised well-known algorithms such as <span class="bold">mergesort</span> to store, retrieve and manipulate the data.</p>
            <p>actors and movies are stored in hash tables, with unique ids as keys. actors contain actor data, in addition to a linked list of movie ids (of movies they starred in) and a linked list of ratings. similarly, movies contain movie data, in addition to a linked list of actor ids (of starring actors) and a linked list of ratings.</p>
